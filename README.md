This is a neural network based digit classifier made without the use of ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.
It is to be used as a test bench for understanding the innerworkings of ML techniques. It currently uses:
  - Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
  - Normalization
  - ReLU activation functions
  - Softmax at output layer
Some of the planned capabilities are: 
  - Adam optimizer
  - Minibatching
  - Learning rate scheduling
