#MNIST Digit Classifier

A neural network based digit classifier made without the use of ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. This is designed to be used as a test bench for understanding the innerworkings of ML techniques. It currently uses:
- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Normalization
- ReLU activation functions
- Softmax at output layer
Some of the planned capabilities are: 
- Adam optimizer
- Minibatching
- Learning rate scheduling

### **Usage**
- adjust the parameters in the main() function, and run the file
