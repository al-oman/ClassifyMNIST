This git is a neural network based digit classifier made without the use of ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.
It is to be used as a test bench for understanding the innerworkings of ML techniques, some of the planned capabilities are: 
  1. Adam optimizer
  2. Minibatching
  3. Learning rate scheduling
